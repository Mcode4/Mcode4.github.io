							<p>I'm an App Academy graduate and a self taught coder. I started with game engines like Roblox and Scratch with the idea of making something I'd like to use. Eventually I got interest in coding and actual development. One of which being the web development and my enrollment in App Academy's bootcamp. Through the course, I've built skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while learning the fundamentals of frontend and backend development.</p>
							<p>Currently I'm going down some of the many pathes of running a homelab in the form of a server. I'm getting the gist of it and added my own flare in with my prior knowledge of programming. I've explored new operating systems outside of windows through virtualization, I've used new remote access tools such as nomachine, virt viewer, rustdesk, and the terminal, and I've experimented with firewalls and even my own virtualizated router with pfsense. I'd says I'd had enough fun to look into a career like cybersecurity or IT but my focus remains on programming.</p>
