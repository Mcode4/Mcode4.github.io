							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I'm a self taught programmer and App Academy graduate. I started with Roblox game then eventually got interest in coding and development. Web development being my focus with my enrollment in App Academy's bootcamp helped me reach my goal. Through the course, I've furthered my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while learning the fundamentals of frontend and backend development.</p>
							<p>The first project I worked on was a site based off of instagram called charstagram. This application was made around a superhero api I found online that sent data about characters which I used to make the profile of the users. Around this time, I only knew JS, HTML, and CSS and it shows in my file structure and code. On the next, Spot Homes, I've learned to create a backend using Express and later learned React for the frontend. The skills I've learned on this project carried on to my next 2 which were almost identical in code stack. Nom Now, and Capstone Academy were my python projects where I used python and flask to create the backend and React for the frontend. I learned basic python syntax and also learned docker and aws which was optional while I was in App Academy's program.</p>
							
							<p>Currently I'm running my own homelab in the form of a server. I've explored new operating systems outside of windows through virtualization and used new remote access tools such as nomachine, virt viewer, rustdesk, and the terminal(ssh). I've experimented with firewalls and even my own virtualizated router with pfsense. I'd says a career in cybersecurity or IT would be my second focus but first is on programming.</p>
							<p>As of June 2025, I got back into coding and learning DS&A using Javascipt. My time since March has mostly been caught up with my new recent job but I'm finding time to learn and hopefully a career in doing what I love, programming.</p>
