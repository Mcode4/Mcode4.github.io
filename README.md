# Marcellies' Portfolio

## About Me
I am Software Engineer from Columbus, GA and passionate about software development. I've being using computers since I was young with my passion being art at the time and I fulling transited into tech. I've been coding in JS for around a year and using Express and Sequelize for around half a year. Using Express I've been able to serve static files alot clears and better in my opinion alongwith using Sequelize to build the backend for a site or app, mostly using SQLite as the language. Recently I've worked with react and redux. React using jsx to render pages and add functionality to alot clearer than a html doc with js and using Redux to access and save values from the backend then use those values in a React frontend.
