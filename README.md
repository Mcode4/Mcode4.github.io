# Marcellies' Portfolio

## About Me
I am a 20 years old, from Columbus, GA and passionate about tech. I've being using computers since I was young for things like gaming and video surfing and my passion at the time being art. I liked anime and cartoons and its also where I got most of my inspiration from for art. After I graduated school around 3 years ago, I decided to put art to the side and try new things and recently I started looking into tech. Seeing I could have an opportunity in tech, I finally got into something I think would be a field I'd love to do and work in.
